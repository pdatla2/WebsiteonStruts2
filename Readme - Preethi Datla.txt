I have used the JDBC 7 version for the DBA connectivity, Servlet API 3.0 and Apache Tomcat 7 version for the server connectivity. 

To import the project, Open the Eclipse EE framework and click on File -> Import and choose Web-> War file and browse the WAR file of my project (First.war), Install Tomcat 7 server before hand, and then click on Run project to open the survey page.
